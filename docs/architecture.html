<p>Batman.js is a <em>MVC framework</em> for building <em>stateful</em> client-side applications. If you understand these concepts, you&#39;ll build a better batman.js app!</p>
<p><h2  class="guide-heading" id="mvc-architecture"><a href='#mvc-architecture'>MVC Architecture</a></h2>
</p>
<p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a common way of dividing an app&#39;s responsibilities. Batman.js borrows its MVC implementation from Rails and Cocoa. There are three main parts:</p>
<p><h4  class="guide-heading" id="models"><a href='#models'>Models</a></h4>
</p>
<p>Models define the <em>business objects</em> in your application. For examples, the models in a blogging app might be <code>Post</code>, <code>Comment</code> and <code>User</code>. These classes may:</p>
<ul>
<li>validate incoming data</li>
<li>persist data </li>
<li>be associated to other models in your app</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/docs/models.html">More About Models</a></p>
<p><h4  class="guide-heading" id="views"><a href='#views'>Views</a></h4>
</p>
<p>Views connect your app to your users by rendering HTML and binding the page to your app. The &quot;view layer&quot; <em>includes</em> HTML templates but goes beyond that: subclasses of <a href="/docs/api/batman.view.html"><code>Batman.View</code></a> are also used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating reusable UI components</li>
<li>handling complex user interactions</li>
<li>rendering into different parts of the page</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/docs/views.html">More About Views</a></p>
<p><h4  class="guide-heading" id="controllers"><a href='#controllers'>Controllers</a></h4>
</p>
<p>Controllers handle route changes. Routes invoke <em>controller actions</em> which may:</p>
<ul>
<li>select &amp; prepare data </li>
<li>render views on the page </li>
<li>persist changes made by the user (eg, clicking &quot;Save&quot;)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>A critical concern of a single-page app is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28computer_science%29#Program_state"><em>state</em></a>, which refers to the information in a program&#39;s memory at a given time. Here are a few considerations for state in batman.js:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Storage is asynchronous.</strong> Especially if you&#39;re using JSON for persistence, loading &amp; saving will be asynchronous. You should set up your app to use callbacks properly (or load some data into your app on page load).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Records &quot;persist&quot; in memory.</strong> When you fetch a record from storage, that record will remain in memory until the user leaves the page (or the record is destroyed). If you fetch the record from storage again, the in-memory copy will be <em>updated</em>, but not replaced. Values set on records will <em>stay</em> set between controller actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Controllers are singletons.</strong> When you first dispatch a controller action, you instantiate that <a href="/docs/api/batman.controller.html"><code>Batman.Controller</code></a> subclass. That <em>same instance</em> will be used to dispatch subsequent actions, so any accessors set on the controller will <em>stay</em> set until you unset them! </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Views are objects.</strong> When batman.js renders HTML, it is &quot;backed&quot; by a <a href="/docs/api/batman.view.html"><code>Batman.View</code></a> instance. The view object creates <em>state</em> for that HTML by maintaining bindings between the HTML and your app. However, views <em>are</em> destroyed between controller actions (unlike controllers and models).</p>
</li>
</ul>
