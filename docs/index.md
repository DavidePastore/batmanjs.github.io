Welcome to batman.js!

This guide will help you understand how batman.js works and how to use it to implement an awesome app.
It includes an overview of MVC and how it relates to batman.js, as well as all the details you need to get started with the framework.

If you're already familiar with the framework and are looking for documentation of a specific component, check out the [API reference](/docs/api/).

*Note: this documentation is still a work in progress and is changing rapidly for the moment. More are coming, but the ones we have here are already much better than the old ones!*
